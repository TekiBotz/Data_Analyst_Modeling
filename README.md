# Regression_Analysis

As a data analyst with access to a large set of historical data I analyzed relationships between different attributes of a house and the houseâ€™s selling price and patterns between different health indicators and the presence of heart disease.

  The models used for this project:
  
  Multiple Regression, 
  Qualitative Variables Interactions, 
  Quadratic Regression, 
  Logistic Regression, 
  Random Forests

After modeling the scenarios I created a summary report on my findings discussing:
  Model building process: How the model was created and trained.
  Evaluation: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
  Interpretation: Insights gained from the model, focusing on a model for its interpretability.
